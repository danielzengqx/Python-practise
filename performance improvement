1.6 -> by index
1.7 -> in place boolean
2.5 -> linked list add
3.3 -> “None” becomes diff value to handle corner
3.5 -> 1, handle the problem, push & pop, 2, optimized ans for solution
4.1 -> better design(performance) -> height never check back
4.2 -> using nodes and set color for each node, DFS -> for graph
4.3 -> why it does not work, copy the standard and search

11.6 -> improve: 1, can track index and report 
     -> 2, not sure 6*6 or bigger matrix
11.7-> can do better using merge or quick sort, even counting sort

The primary focus 

checking the best method -> pick up the basic components && write better approach
