#A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anoth- erâ€™s shoulders. 
#For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. 
#Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of peo- ple in such a tower.



#EXAMPLE:
#Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
#Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
