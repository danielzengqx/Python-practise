#Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. 
#When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. 
#On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponentâ€™s pieces. 
#The game ends when either user has no more valid moves, and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. 
#Implement the object oriented design for Othello.
